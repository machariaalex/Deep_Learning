# Deep_Learning
# Digit Recognition
This repository contains code and resources for a digit recognition project using machine learning algorithms.

## Description
The digit recognition project aims to build a model that can accurately identify handwritten digits. The repository includes:

## Training and testing datasets: 
The MNIST dataset or any other dataset used for digit recognition.
Python code: Implementation of machine learning algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics.
Model files: Pretrained models or serialized model objects.
Jupyter Notebook: Example notebooks demonstrating the usage and evaluation of the models.
## Dependencies
To run the code and reproduce the results, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. (Specify all required libraries and their versions)
You can install the dependencies using pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
